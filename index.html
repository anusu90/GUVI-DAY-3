        			As an ex-civil services aspirant, I have learned to adapt, strive under pressure, and manage time efficiently. Despite my bachelor's in Mechanical, I have always had a pull towards programming. With the capability to self-learn, I have developed my knowledge in programming concepts and languages like â€” python, C, to note a few. My goal is to seek a challenging career that can utilize my talents and diverse skill set ensuring mutual growth and development.
